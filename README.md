# Nap-Pad

A 60% keyboard with RGB and a rotary encoder. Made for sleepers, by sleepers. It is portable and very relaxing. Made with KiCAD and Fusion 360 and by Shayaan.is.sleep//The_DuckðŸ¦† (me) I designed this to be very minimal and to adhere to a specific color scheme. I have a black with blue accents computer and a white desk, so I want the case and keycaps to reflect that. This keyboard is an extension project for my hackpad, which I have built at the time of writing. This would just be the normal, default 60% keyboards you find at your local Best Buy. (look in Assets folder for pdf of schematic)

## Motavation
I wanted to add more features that I missed out on in my hackpad. One thing I really wanted was an ACC matrix in my schematic. This would allow me to not be constricted by the number of GPIO pins on my chip. I did not want to make a full 104-key keyboard because I thought it would be too much of a jump from a 6-key keypad to a full-size one.
