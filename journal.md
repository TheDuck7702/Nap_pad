## Day 1 - june 11 10:00 pm
So the plan is to start the full size project today, and than ill try to finish this by the weekend. I did the HackPad so i do have some experience behind my belt but i never used materials or an oled screen so i'm a bit worried about that. What i plan to do is that ill have around 61 keys all connected into a grid and that into the pico. Ill also have a rotery encoder and sm rgb. Ill scrap the rgb if i run out of time.
- Started making the grid for the switches and started to plan out my pins for the pico
- finshed the keys but they are too big. Im looking at other submitions but my grid thign i have my keys ina re way to big. They like thake up more than half the sheet so i goot find a solutioon for that. But overall it was a nice productive 2 hours.

## Day 2 - June 15 5:00am
so i kinda procastanated too much and i didnt do it for like3 days. its rly erly inthe morning and i js finsihded the rgbs. I was going to do it so each swich will have tis own led, but to save cost, ill have 10-20 leds, around the board, and transperent key caps to make some sort of backlight. I looked as sm guides to understand how to wire them and yea.
